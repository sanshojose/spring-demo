Caching Actor
-------------
The caching actor acts as a proxy between services and controllers.
The caching actor will receive different types of messages to allow it to respond to different needs such as requests to refresh data.

GetCachable is the primary use case - the cache will try to get the record from the persistent store (cassandra).
If the record is not received, then the request will be passed to the service actor.
When the record comes back from the service actor, then the caching actor places the record in the cache and pipes back the result
to the requesting component.
